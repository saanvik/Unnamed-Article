\section{What about HTML?  What about XML?}
\label{sec:xml}

That's a great question.

HTML currently doesn't support decent typography.  You need to combine it with CSS, and most CSS is designed for the screen.  While there are some systems for crafting PDFs from HTML and CSS, that's not the focus.

XML is, well, if someone created a DITA version of Authorea I'd probably switch to it.  I'd prefer pure semantics over the mix of semantics and layout that is inherent in \LaTeX\ but since that doesn't exist, I'm left with this.

\emph{But} Authorea does actually use XML, at least in some way.  If you look at \href{https://www.authorea.com/users/5713/articles/28015-how-to-write-latex-for-power-users}{How to Write \LaTeX\ (For Power Users)} that indicates they use a project called \href{http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/}{LaTeXML} a project I have never heard of before. It's only a partial \LaTeX\ implementation, though, so I wonder whether this will work for me.
