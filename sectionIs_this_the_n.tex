\section{Is this the next big thing for me?}
I love good page layout.  I'm also lazy.  I also prefer, whenever possible, to use plain text, not binary text.  HTML and XML are great for web display, but for years I've been longing to use \TeX\ or \LaTeX\ for all of my writing.  I think I've found the platform for that - \href{http://www.authorea.com}{Authorea}.  It's aimed at researchers, but it fits the bill for me.

Here are some of the things I like about it:

\begin{itemize}
\item Decent web view
\item Context aware commenting
\item Anonymous sharing (anyone can read my writing)
\item Easy sharing with Facebook and Twitter
\item Supports \LaTeX\ (I have tried vanilla \TeX\ yet)
\item Easily export a very nice PDF using all the power of \TeX
\item Free (maybe ...)
\item Offline access by linking with \url{http://github.com}
\end{itemize}

Here's what I dislike, at least so far:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reader stats
\item git project structure is controlled by a MarkDown file
\end{itemize}
