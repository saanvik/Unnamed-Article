\section{What about Medium? What about a blog?}
\label{sec:medium}

Look, Medium is great, so are blogs.  I've got a lot written at both.  But let's be honest, they are dead ends.  You put it there and that's it.  Yes, yes, I can export from them and get \emph{something}, but that something isn't worth much.

If I can keep my writing in \LaTeX\ I can always use it.
